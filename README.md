# Space Trash
A simple game where meteors fall from the sky, and the player must deflect them to avoid destruction. The player can interact with meteors, and the game features randomized meteor types, and speeds.

# Features added
* Meteors fall from the top of the screen at random speeds and positions.
* Player can deflect meteors using a button.
* Meteors are represented by different shapes (circle, rectangle, polygon).
* Meteors spawn at regular intervals.

# To-Do List
* Figure out how to track player movement (dots every 10 secs?)(Don't blow up laptop lol).
* Speed up shapes based on time passed.
* Clean up sizing of everything :/.
* Add objective ex. "Don't hit triangles" 
* Fix deflect bug about it getting hit multiple times.
* Sound Effects: Add sounds for meteor deflections, explosions, and other game events.
* Game Over Mechanism: Implement a condition where the game ends (e.g., a meteor hits the player).
UI/UX Enhancements: Improve the game's user interface, such as adding a start screen, pause button, and game over screen.
