# Space Trash
A simple game where meteors fall from the sky, and the player must deflect them to avoid destruction. The player can interact with meteors, and the game features randomized meteor types, and speeds.

# Features added
* Meteors fall from the top of the screen at random speeds and positions.
* Player can deflect meteors using a button.
* Meteors are represented by different shapes (circle, rectangle, polygon).
* Meteors spawn at regular intervals.

# To-Do List
* Make Player Paddles move based on arrow keys and wasd keys.
* Clean up sizing of everything :/.
* Interaction Between Meteor and Player: Add logic for when a meteor interacts with the player, such as being deflected or destroyed.
* Background: Add a dynamic or static background to make the game more visually appealing.
* Scoring System: Implement a system that tracks the number of meteors deflected or destroyed.
* Sound Effects: Add sounds for meteor deflections, explosions, and other game events.
* Game Over Mechanism: Implement a condition where the game ends (e.g., a meteor hits the player).
UI/UX Enhancements: Improve the game's user interface, such as adding a start screen, pause button, and game over screen.
